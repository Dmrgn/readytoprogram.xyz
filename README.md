# Ready to Program Documentation â˜•

[https://readytoprogram.netlify.app/](https://readytoprogram.netlify.app/)

## Overview

Ready to Program has not been maintained since HoltSoft became defunct and the hsa library was last updated on July 18th 2003. This has lead Ready to Program to age significantly. [The original documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20070622130456/http://www.holtsoft.com/java/hsa_package.html) is only available through *The Wayback Machine* and its early 2000s formatting, word choice and navigation make it a nightmare to find the right information.


This website's goal is to provide highschool students with an accessible and modern place to get Ready to Program's documentation, all in one place. Created by suffering high schoolers, for suffering high schoolers.
