## Overview

This documentation outlines how to work with the `java.awt.Color` class in Ready to Program.

The initial active colour a of a newly created `hsa.Console` is `java.awt.Color.BLACK`. This means that any geometry drawn will be black.

You can change the active colour with a call to `void hsa.Console.setColour(java.awt.Color colour)` or with American spelling `void hsa.Console.setColor(java.awt.Color color)`.

It is best practice to use only the American English spelling or only the British English spelling throughout your entire program.

```java
import hsa.Console; // or hsa.*;
import java.awt.Color;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // the initial active colour is black
        Console c = new Console();
        // set the active colour to red
        c.setColour(Color.RED);
    }
}
```

The above example uses a static constant specified as a member of the `java.awt.Color` class. You can find a complete list of the `java.awt.Color` constants [here.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)

## Creating Colours

### Constructors

You can also create your own colours through a `java.awt.Color` constructor:

- `java.awt.Color java.awt.Color(int r, int g, int b)`
- `java.awt.Color java.awt.Color(int r, int g, int b, int a)`
- `java.awt.Color java.awt.Color(float r, float g, float b)`
- `java.awt.Color java.awt.Color(float r, float g, float b, float a)`

### Parameters

- `int r` specifies the amount of red in the created colour (between 0 and 255 inclusive).
- `int g` specifies the amount of green in the created colour (between 0 and 255 inclusive).
- `int b` specifies the amount of blue in the created colour (between 0 and 255 inclusive).
- `float r` specifies the amount of red in the created colour as a float (between 0 and 1 inclusive).
- `float g` specifies the amount of green in the created colour as a float (between 0 and 1 inclusive).
- `float b` specifies the amount of blue in the created colour as a float (between 0 and 1 inclusive).

You can find the complete reference to the `java.awt.Color` class [here.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)

### Example

```java
// create a colour with 100% red, 0% green and 0% blue
Color myColour = new Color(255, 0, 0);
c.setColour(myColour);
// create a colour with 50% red, 90% green and 20% blue
Color myColour1 = new Color(0.5, 0.9, 0.2);
c.setColour(myColour1);
```

## Colour Pickers

It is difficult to visualize what a colour will look like exclusively through 3 numeric values. Luckily, the internet is home to several different colour picking utilities that you can access in your browser.

For example: [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/).

You will want to copy the "RGB" value.

hmmm...
