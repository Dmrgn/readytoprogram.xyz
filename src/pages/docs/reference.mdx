## Overview

### JavaDoc

You can view Ready to Program's classes in JavaDoc format [here.](https://readytoprogram-javadoc.netlify.app)

### Extra Classes

You may notice that the package contains more than the advertised 9 classes:

- `hsa.Console`
- `hsa.TextConsole`
- `hsa.Stdin`
- `hsa.Stdout`
- `hsa.TextInputFile`
- `hsa.TextOutputFile`
- `hsa.FatalError`
- `hsa.Message`
- `hsa.Status`

It also includes:

- `hsa.Animator`
- `hsa.Bounceable`
- `hsa.Moveable`
- `hsa.Paintable`
- `hsa.PaintBug`
- `hsa.PhoneBook`
- `hsa.SavePrint`
- `hsa.TreeNode`
- `hsa.TreeUtil`
- `hsa.VisibleHanoi`
- `hsa.VisualSortUtil`

### Towers of Hanoi

Some of these classes are used internally by hsa. Others were clearly added with the intention of them being used a teaching tools. For example, the `hsa.VisibleHanoi` class provides a simple ["Towers of Hanoi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) simulation window with basic methods for creating your own solution to the problem.

This class is fully featured and complete, yet there is no existing reference to it anywhere on what is left of [the original HoltSoft website](https://web.archive.org/web/20000823061134/http://www.holtsoft.com/java/home.html).

You can see an example of the class in action here:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

import hsa.*;

class Hanoi {

    static ArrayList<Integer> possibleStacks = new ArrayList<Integer>();

    // solves the Towers of Hanoi problem with any number of disks
    // in a recursive implementation
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        possibleStacks.addAll(Arrays.asList(1,2,3));

        int numDisks = 5;

        // yes this is built into ready to program \(;-.)/
        VisibleHanoi vs = new VisibleHanoi(numDisks);

        // move all rings from the first stack to the last stack
        moveStack(vs, 1, 3, numDisks);
    }

    public static void moveStack(VisibleHanoi vs, int start, int end, int depth) {
        // if its just us then move to where we were told to go
        if (depth == 1) {
            vs.moveTop(start, end);
            return;
        }
        // otherwise move everything above us to the free stack
        int oppositeStack = (int)possibleStacks.stream()
            .filter(p -> (p!=start && p!=end)).toArray()[0];
        moveStack(vs, start, oppositeStack, depth-1);
        
        // then move to where we want to go
        vs.moveTop(start, end);

        // and move everything that was previously above us, back on top of us
        moveStack(vs, oppositeStack, end, depth-1);
        return;
    }
}
```
