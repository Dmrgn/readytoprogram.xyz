## Overview

This guide will teach you how to install and configure Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to work with Java and the hsa library.

---

## Installing Visual Studio Code

You can install Visual Studio Code from the official website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Download the apropriate version for your system.

### Setup

Open the downloaded executable. When prompted, accept the license agreement. Its recommended that you allow the installer to create a desktop shortcut. After the installer has finished, launch VSCode.  

### Java Setup

First we will be installing a set of extensions to make working with Java projects easier. Navigate to the extensions menu on the left side of the VSCode window. In the search bar type `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack` and press enter. The first result should be called `Extension Pack for Java`. Click on the install button.

Next we will be installing a Java JDK. Open the VSCode command palette (ctrl/cmd + shift + p) and type `Java: Install New JDK`. Press enter. Select download and follow the download instructions to completion. Return to the VSCode window and select `Reload Window` in the `Install New JDK` menu, or open the command pallete (ctrl/cmd + shift + p) and type `Developer: Reload Window`.

### hsa Setup

Next we will be creating a template Java project which includes the hsa library files. First create a folder somewhere on your computer where you would like to store all of your Java projects (e.g `My Documents/Java Projects`). Then create a folder called `template hsa` inside of your Java projects folder. Move the hsa library files into the `template hsa` folder so that it forms this file structure:

```
/Java Projects
    /template hsa
        /hsa
            Animator.java
            Console.java
            etc...
```

If you do not have the hsa library files, you can download them [here](/downloads/hsa.zip). Extract it.

Then open VSCode and select `File/Open Folder` from the top menu. Navigate to and open the `template hsa` folder on your computer. Next create a file called `Main.java` inside of `template hsa`. You can do this inside of VSCode by selecting (`File/New File`) from the top menu and then selecting `New Java Class` from the dropdown. Save the file with (ctrl/cmd + s) and ensure it is named properly as `Main.java`.

Your final file structure should look like:

```
/Java Projects
    /template hsa
        /hsa
            Animator.java
            Console.java
            etc...
        Main.java
```

### Test That Everything Works

Inside of the `Main.java` file, write the following code:

```java
import hsa.Console;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Console c = new Console();
        c.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Save the file with (ctrl/cmd + s) and run it by selecting the play button in the top right corner of the VSCode window. You should see a window pop up with the printed text `Hello, World!`.

## Creating a New Project

Creating a new project with hsa is as simple as duplicating the `template hsa` folder. Then add any code to the Main.java file and create more files as needed.

## Learning VSCode

Visual Studio Code has some official tips and tricks on their website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks).

Almost everything in VSCode is customizable, you can learn how to change VSCode's theme by following the link [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

hsa is *ancient* software and getting it running on modern systems is no easy feat. Consider the following a list of common issues and their potential solutions.

- `The import hsa cannot be resolved`

This error means that Java can not find the hsa class files. Ensure that the `hsa` folder containing ~29 files with the .java extension is present in the project directory. Also ensure that the hsa folder is unzipped.

- `Console cannot be resolved to a type`

This error likely means that you forgot to type `import hsa.Console;` or `import hsa.*;` at the top of the file.

### Found Something Else?

If you ran into a different issue and have found the solution, this page is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmrgn). Consider adding your issue and solution to this list.
